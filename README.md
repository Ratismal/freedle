<h1>What is Freedle?</h1>
<p>
  Yeah, I'm not gonna bullshit you.
  This is just Wordle. You know, that word guessing game.
  I'm not gonna bother explaining the rules,
  I'm sure you already know. 'Cuz this is just Wordle.
</p>

<p>
  ...but it's also Wordle that's been rewritten from scratch,
  <a href="https://github.com/ratismal/freedle" target="_blank">open-sourced</a>,
  guaranteed to always be free, never paywalled,
  with absolutely no analytics or tracking.
  With a bunch of new features jammed in that I thought
  were neat.
</p>

<p>
  I'm making this for myself. You're welcome to use it too. Have fun.
